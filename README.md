# flamaster

According to the Polish Wikipedia `flamaster` translates to [marker pen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_pen). That's sufficiently close.

This little ugly project here is about filling in those templates with inputs from some [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file. Simple and useful.

*Very much WIP state*

It already works for me though.
